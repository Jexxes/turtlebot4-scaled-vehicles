## Faster Charging 
You can unplug the adapter board from the robot which will decrease the power-usage and increase the speed with which the robot charges. This is very helpful when strapped on time.

### Step 1: Power Off TurtleBot
Remove the TurtleBot from the charging dock and power it off. Removing the adapter board while the robot is on is not recommended.  


### Step 2: Remove Backplate
Remove the backplate from the TurtleBot.
