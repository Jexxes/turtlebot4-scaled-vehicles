# Project Overview

This project is focused on the development and documentation of the TurtleBot4 robot and the GulliView system. The repository is structured into two main directories: Documentation and Software. 

## Where to begin
To set up and as quickly as possible start to use the Turtlebot, we recommend the following approach: 
1. [Base Setup](/Documentation/TurtleBot4/Setup/Base-Setup.md)
2. [Network Discovery Server](/Documentation/TurtleBot4/Setup/Network-Discovery-Server.md)  
Once this has been set up, you can create a remote server
3. [Remote Server](/Documentation/TurtleBot4/Setup/Remote-Server.md)  
Then you can proceed to start getting code to run for road navigation. 
4. [Road Navigation](/Software/TurtleBot4/road_navigate/)


## Documentation

[The Documentation directory](Documentation) contains detailed information about the hardware and software components of the TurtleBot4 and GulliView systems as well as instructions on how to set them up.  

[The Software directory](/Software/) contains code that has been used in our project. This include [Road Navigation](/Software/TurtleBot4/road_navigate/) etc.  

### TurtleBot4 

[This](Documentation/TurtleBot4/) directory contains comprehensive documentation about the TurtleBot4 system. It includes information about the on-board computers, setup instructions, sensor details, and troubleshooting guides. Here are some key files: 

- [On-Board Computers](Documentation/TurtleBot4/On-Board-Computers/): Detailed information about the Raspberry Pi 4B used in the TurtleBot4, including how to flash the SD card.
- [Setup](Documentation/TurtleBot4/Setup/): Instructions on how to set up the TurtleBot4, including network setup and ROS configuration.
- [Troubleshooting](Documentation/TurtleBot4/Troubleshooting/): Guides to help you troubleshoot issues with the TurtleBot4, including sensor problems, issues experienced during initial setup and more. 

### GulliView

[This](Documentation/GulliView/) directory contains documentation about the GulliView system.

## Software

[The Software directory](Software) contains the software components of the TurtleBot4 and GulliView systems. (Note: Detailed information about the software components is not provided in the current workspace.)
